# HEAL Parks: 2024 Playground Analysis
Ronald W. Buie

# Front Matter

This document outlines procedures, technical considerations, and
analytic results for a 2024 analysis of playgrounds within parks
participating in the HEAL Parks Study. The primary purpose of this PDF
is technical review by analyst and project managers to confirm the
process and data quality.

For general information about the project please review the
[git](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/HEAL_Parks_Analysis) or contact Seth
Schromen-Wawrin.

## Major inputs

The following inputs to this script are contained at ./inputs/*.* and
include

- A file of park meta data, including address, zip, city, neighborhood,
  official name, and REDCap name for each park
- A file of collected SOPARC observations, aggregated to the period
  level, currently updated for 2022-2024
- An accompanying file of SOPARC activities, currently updated for
  2022-2024

In addition, access to APDE’s population estimates, or calculated
population estimates for children living within 1/2 mile for all parks
included in the analysis.

## Output categories

- tables - tabular outputs of analysis, generally in xlsx format
- charts - chart outputs of analysis, generally in pdf and/or png format

## This is a quarto generated document

By rendering/knitting the qmd file, the analysis is re-executed, this
document rebuilt, and new outputs are generated. To learn more about
Quarto see (https://quarto.org).

# Setup & Environment

This script was last executed using R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt).

# Data Preperation

This analysis relies on park observations and park activity tables
created in the annual SOPARC study. Please contact Ronald W. Buie or
Seth Schromen-Wawrin for details on this prior work.

Some parks were included in the data set because observers practiced
there. However these are not part of the playground study

## Park catchment

Some analyses require park catchment information. We use the population
within .5 miles of a central coordinate for the park. All ages
population is provided in the data set generated by our annual analysis.
For this playground study we also calculate the population of 0-14 year
olds within 0.5 miles of each park.

# Analyses

The below analyses are exploratory, descriptive, statistics to support
further investigation into the equitable use and maintenance of
municipal parks across King County. In providing these results we hope
to facilitate discussion around this work and how to proceed going
forward.

Some important questions to ask as you review these results are:

- Do the results appear reasonable, or do the numbers for some parks
  appear unlikely to be accurate?
- Do the proposed questions seem valuable to ask?
- For a given analysis, is it well defined and are the data accurate?
- For a given analysis, is this a helpful way to present the results?
- Do any results suggest that we should investigate further, if
  possible?
- Do any results suggest that we should not investigate further?

Notes:

- The below analyses are limited to 2024 observation data. In future
  versions, we expect to include data from all years.

<!-- -->

- Analyses of “average park use” aggregate all playground target areas
  within the park (effectively calculated as one large playground)

- Multiple park characteristics in the supplemental information file
  have n/a or tbd for parks that, including for parks that have
  playgrounds. Depending on the analysis, these may be suppressed, or
  show up as NA, tbd, or 0

## Analyses of park catchment and status

These analyses explore the relationship between classification and
funding status of a park and the surrounding population. Park catchment
may, additionally, provide context for later analyses below.

## Analyses of playground use

The below analyses explore relationships of the number of people
observed in playgrounds and other characteristics or status of the park.
We refer to this number of observed users as “use”. For most of these
analyses, use is provided in three forms, the average number of users
observed across all observed days, the median number of users across all
days, and the peak number of users across all days.

### playground use by number of play elements and primary age groups

Primary age group is a status provided by parks managers that designates
the age groups that the playground is target for. The two age groups are
5-12 and 2-5. A playground may be designed to serve both.

## Analyses of playground popularity

These analyses explore the relationship between popularity of a park’s
playground relative to other characteristics of the park. Playground
popularity is defined as the proportion of users who are observed in the
playground versus all users. For example, if 20 users were observed in
the park, and 10 of those were in the playground, the playground
popularity would be 50%. Popularity is based on the total users observed
across all days, rather than a daily average.
