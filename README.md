# Data Description

Data are collected annually by on the ground observers. These observers are assigned to a series of parks and asked to complete the SPARC survey instrument in the morning, afternoon, and evening of 3 days per assigned park. 

## Parks as multi level groups

While a park is the primary unit of analysis, data on each park are collected in areas and sub-areas. Areas are pre-defined spaces of a park, generally based on visibility (to the researcher) requiring unique observation points, or by equipment/use of an area that distinguishes it from other areas of the same park. In addition, an area may be further subdevided into sub-areas. Sub-areas are not pre-defined, and are created as-needed by the observer in order to make observation practical.
